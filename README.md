## 🔧 **Feature Engineering**

Feature Engineering transforms raw data into meaningful insights and improves the performance of machine learning models. The following steps were performed:

### **1. RFM Features**  
- **Recency**: Days since the customer's last purchase.  
- **Frequency**: Number of transactions per customer.  
- **Monetary Value**: Total revenue generated by each customer.  

### **2. Time-Based Features**  
- Extracted features like **hour**, **day**, **week**, and **month** from the purchase date to capture temporal purchasing patterns.

### **3. Revenue and Quantity Metrics**  
- **Average Revenue per Order**  
- **Total Revenue per Customer**  
- **Average Quantity Sold per Transaction**  

### **4. Customer Segmentation**  
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on RFM scores, identifying high-value and low-value groups.  

### **Purpose**  
These engineered features enable better analysis, improved model performance, and actionable customer insights. 🚀  

### **5. Customer Segmentation using K-Means**

The K-Means clustering algorithm was applied to segment customers based on their RFM features:  

- **Recency**: Time since last purchase.  
- **Frequency**: Total number of purchases.  
- **Monetary Value**: Total revenue generated.  

The resulting clusters are visualized below:  

#### **K-Means Clustering Plot**  
<div align="center">  
  <img src="plots/customer_segmentation_kmeans.png" alt="Customer Segmentation using K-Means" width="600">  
</div>  

### **Insights**  
- **Cluster 1 (Red)**: High-value and frequent buyers.  
- **Cluster 2 (Green)**: Customers with high monetary value but low frequency.  
- **Cluster 3 (Cyan)**: Regular customers with moderate activity.  
- **Cluster 4 (Purple)**: Infrequent and low-value customers.  

**Purpose**:  
This segmentation helps businesses identify customer behaviors, enabling targeted marketing strategies and resource optimization. 🚀

## 6. Predictive Modeling 📈

### **Sales Forecasting**

We applied **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to predict hourly sales trends for better inventory and revenue planning. The baseline model was configured using **ARIMA(3,1,3)(0,0,1)[24]**, indicating seasonal adjustment with 24-hour cycles.

**Steps:**
- Prepared hourly revenue data and tested for stationarity.
- Optimized ARIMA model parameters using AIC for best fit.
- Forecasted future hourly sales with **confidence intervals** (80% and 95%) to account for uncertainty.
- Validated the model using residual analysis and Ljung-Box test.

**Results:**
- **Forecast Plot**: Displayed actual vs. predicted sales with confidence intervals.
- **Residual Analysis**: The residuals appear random with no significant autocorrelation, suggesting a good model fit.

#### Key Metrics:
- **Mean Error (ME)**: `11.77`
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: `3039.78`
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `1843.33`
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: `336.65%`
- **Ljung-Box Test (p-value)**: `0.3741` (Residuals show no significant autocorrelation).

**Plots:**
1. **Interactive Hourly Sales Forecast**: Shows the actual values vs. the forecasted values along with confidence intervals.  
   ![Hourly Sales Forecast](plots/newplot_18.png)

2. **Residual Diagnostics**: Ensures residuals are normally distributed and uncorrelated, validating model accuracy.

### **Next Steps**
- Further refine the model using additional seasonal components or deep learning techniques (LSTM).
- Explore ensemble methods (e.g., SARIMA + XGBoost) to improve forecast accuracy.
- Scale forecasting to include monthly or weekly sales trends.
