### **3.4 Distribution of Recency (Customer Segmentation)**
The distribution of **recency** – days since a customer's last purchase – shows important insights into customer activity.

![Distribution of Recency](plots/recency_distribution.png)

**Key Insights**:
1. **Majority of Customers are Inactive**:
   - A significant portion of customers have not made a purchase in a long time, indicating potential churn.

2. **Skewed Distribution**:
   - Most customers have high recency values (inactive), while very few have low recency values (recent activity).

3. **Retention Opportunity**:
   - Customers with high recency values can be targeted with **re-engagement campaigns** to revive interest.
   - Recent customers should be incentivized to ensure continued loyalty.

---

### **3.5 Revenue Distribution by Country**
The map below visualizes **revenue distribution across countries**.  
Countries with higher revenue are highlighted in darker shades. The **United Kingdom** and **Australia** dominate in terms of revenue contribution.

![Revenue Distribution by Country](plots/revenue_map.png)

**Key Insights**:
- Revenue is concentrated in a few major markets, primarily in the **UK**, followed by other European countries and Australia.
- Emerging opportunities may exist in countries with lower revenue contributions.

---

### **3.6 Sales Trends by Hour of Day**
The plot below shows the **total revenue generated across different hours of the day**.  

![Sales Trends by Hour of Day](plots/sales_by_hour.png)

**Key Insights**:
1. Sales activity **peaks between 10 AM and 3 PM**, with the highest revenue observed around midday.
2. Early mornings and evenings have lower sales volumes, suggesting focused business hours.

## 🔧 **Feature Engineering**

Feature Engineering transforms raw data into meaningful insights and improves the performance of machine learning models. The following steps were performed:

### **1. RFM Features**  
- **Recency**: Days since the customer's last purchase.  
- **Frequency**: Number of transactions per customer.  
- **Monetary Value**: Total revenue generated by each customer.  

### **2. Time-Based Features**  
- Extracted features like **hour**, **day**, **week**, and **month** from the purchase date to capture temporal purchasing patterns.

### **3. Revenue and Quantity Metrics**  
- **Average Revenue per Order**  
- **Total Revenue per Customer**  
- **Average Quantity Sold per Transaction**  

### **4. Customer Segmentation**  
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on RFM scores, identifying high-value and low-value groups.  

### **Purpose**  
These engineered features enable better analysis, improved model performance, and actionable customer insights. 🚀  

### **5. Customer Segmentation using K-Means**

The K-Means clustering algorithm was applied to segment customers based on their RFM features:  

- **Recency**: Time since last purchase.  
- **Frequency**: Total number of purchases.  
- **Monetary Value**: Total revenue generated.  

The resulting clusters are visualized below:  

#### **K-Means Clustering Plot**  
<div align="center">  
  <img src="plots/customer_segmentation_kmeans.png" alt="Customer Segmentation using K-Means" width="600">  
</div>  

### **Insights**  
- **Cluster 1 (Red)**: High-value and frequent buyers.  
- **Cluster 2 (Green)**: Customers with high monetary value but low frequency.  
- **Cluster 3 (Cyan)**: Regular customers with moderate activity.  
- **Cluster 4 (Purple)**: Infrequent and low-value customers.  

**Purpose**:  
This segmentation helps businesses identify customer behaviors, enabling targeted marketing strategies and resource optimization. 🚀
